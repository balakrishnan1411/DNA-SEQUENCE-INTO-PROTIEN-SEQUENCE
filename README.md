#FASTA to Protein Sequence Converter
This script converts nucleotide sequences from a FASTA file into protein sequences using Biopython.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Biopython library (pip install biopython)


Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Prepare your input:

Ensure your input FASTA file (sequence.fasta) contains nucleotide sequences that can be translated into proteins.
Run the script:

python fasta_to_protein.py

Output:
The script will print the translated protein sequences to the console.
Example
If your sequence.fasta file contains the following content:

>Seq1
ATGGTGGCA
>Seq2
ATGCGCGTA
>
Running the script will produce:

MGTA
MARA


Notes
This script uses the default genetic code table for translation provided by Biopython.
Ensure that Biopython is correctly installed (pip install biopython) before running the script.
